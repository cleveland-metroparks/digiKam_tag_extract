# digiKam_tag_extract

This is designed as a simple example of how to set up `camtrapR` functions to extract image data from images tagged using digiKam.

To digiKam_tag_extract saves a record table locally and in outdir.

The output can be used to create database tables to get this into postgres using recordTable_to_postgre.Rmd

It should be possible for others to change this to do something similar.
